   abstract = {If mankind is to explore the solar system beyond the confines of our Earth and Moon the problem of radiation protection must be addressed. Galactic cosmic rays and highly variable energetic solar particles are an ever-present hazard in interplanetary space. Electric and/or magnetic fields have been suggested as deflection shields in the past, but these treated space as an empty vacuum. In fact it is not empty. Space contains a plasma known as the solar wind; a constant flow of protons and electrons coming from the Sun. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of a "mini-magnetosphere" acting as a radiation protection shield. We explicitly include the plasma physics necessary to account for the solar wind and its induced effects. We show that, by capturing/containing this plasma, we enhance the effectiveness of the shield. Further evidence to support our conclusions can be obtained from studying naturally occurring "mini-magnetospheres" on the Moon. These magnetic anomalies (related to "lunar swirls") exhibit many of the effects seen in laboratory experiments and computer simulations. If shown to be feasible, this technology could become the gateway to manned exploration of interplanetary space. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.},

   abstract = {We present the results of the first local hybrid simulations (particle ions and fluid electrons) for the solar wind plasma interaction with realistic lunar crustal fields. We use a three-dimensional hybrid model of plasma and an empirical model of the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly based on Lunar Prospector observations. We examine the effects of low and high solar wind dynamic pressures on this interaction when the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly is located at nearly 20 degrees solar zenith angle. We find that for low solar wind dynamic pressure, the crustal fields mostly deflect the solar wind plasma, form a plasma void at very close distances to the Moon (below 20km above the surface), and reflect nearly 5% of the solar wind in charged form. In contrast, during high solar wind dynamic pressure, the crustal fields are more compressed, the solar wind is less deflected, and the lunar surface is less shielded from impinging solar wind flux, but the solar wind ion reflection is more locally intensified (up to 25%) compared to low dynamic pressures. The difference is associated with an electrostatic potential that forms over the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly as well as the effects of solar wind plasma on the crustal fields during low and high dynamic pressures. Finally, we show that an antimoonward Hall electric field is the dominant electric field for similar to 3km altitude and higher, and an ambipolar electric field has a noticeable contribution to the electric field at close distances (<3km) to the Moon.},

   abstract = {The formation of electric potential over lunar magnetized regions is essential for understanding fundamental lunar science, for understanding the lunar environment, and for planning human exploration on the Moon. A large positive electric potential was predicted and detected from single point measurements. Here, we demonstrate a remote imaging technique of electric potential mapping at the lunar surface, making use of a new concept involving hydrogen neutral atoms derived from solar wind. We apply the technique to a lunar magnetized region using an existing dataset of the neutral atom energy spectrometer SARA/CENA on Chandrayaan-1. Electrostatic potential larger than +135 V inside the Gerasimovic anomaly is confirmed. This structure is found spreading all over the magnetized region. The widely spread electric potential can influence the local plasma and dust environment near the magnetic anomaly. Citation: Futaana, Y., S. Barabash, M. Wieser, C. Lue, P. Wurz, A. Vorburger, A.

   abstract = {Using a two-dimensional hybrid simulation, we study the physics of the interaction of the solar wind with a localized magnetic field concentration, or "magcon," on the Moon. Our simulation treats the solar wind protons kinetically and the electrons as a charge-neutralizing fluid. This approach is necessary because the characteristic scale of the magcon is of the same order or smaller than the proton inertial length-the characteristic scale in the hybrid simulation. Specifically, we consider a case in which the incident solar wind flows exactly normal to the lunar surface, and the magcon is represented by a simple dipole whose moment is parallel to the surface, with a center just below it. We find that while the magcon causes the solar wind to be deflected and decelerated, it does not completely shield the lunar surface anywhere. However, protons which impact the surface in the center of the magnetic anomaly have energies well below the solar wind ram energy. Thus, in this region, any backscattered neutral particles resulting from the interaction of solar wind protons with the lunar regolith would have energies lower than that of the solar wind. Moreover, very few neutrals, if any, would emanate from within the magcon with energies comparable to the solar wind energy. This may explain recent observations of lunar energetic neutral atoms associated with a strong crustal magnetic anomaly. Our study also finds that a significant fraction of the incoming solar wind protons are reflected back into space before reaching the surface. These particles are reflected by a strong electrostatic field which results from the difference in the proton and electron inertia. The reflected particles are seen at very high altitudes above the Moon, over 200km, and over a much broader spatial scale than the magcon, several hundred kilometers at least. Our simulation also revealed a second population of reflected particles which originate from the side of the magcon where the interplanetary and magcon magnetic fields are directed opposite to one another, leading to a magnetic topology much like magnetic reconnection. As previously reflected particles move through this region, they are deflected upward, away from the surface, forming a second component. Our simulation has a number of similarities to recent in situ spacecraft observations of reflected ions above and around magcons.},

   abstract = {We present Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) observations of electron-wave interactions which extend to quite large distances upstream from the Moon. We first study electron velocity distributions and wave spectra on an event basis. In both the solar wind and terrestrial plasma sheet, we observe strong whistler wave activity on the magnetic field lines connected to the dayside lunar surface. These whistlers are most likely driven by the anisotropy of upward electrons caused by surface absorption. The whistler growth rates computed from the measured electron distributions successfully reproduced the spectral characteristics of the observed approximate to 100 Hz narrowband oscillations and those reaching lower frequencies. Meanwhile, the incoming solar wind strahl beam is occasionally isotropized near the Moon, and broadband electrostatic waves are observed simultaneously, suggesting streaming instabilities between the incoming and outgoing beams. Based on the case study, we statistically survey the spatial variations of the characteristic quantities of the upstream electron-wave interactions. Both the electron anisotropy and electromagnetic wave intensity decay with increasing field line distances but remain higher than the ambient level at 6 lunar radii (approximate to 10,000 km) or more. The strahl electron isotropization and electrostatic waves are found mainly at lower altitudes below 1 lunar radius. The electron anisotropy and whistler intensity exhibit clear anticorrelation with crustal magnetic fields, indicating that the magnetic anomalies suppress the whistler wave growth. The ARTEMIS observations convincingly illustrate that the lunar influence on electrons reaches out to 6 lunar radii or more upstream from the Moon.},

   abstract = {Many of the Moon's crustal magnetic anomalies are accompanied by high albedo features known as swirls. A leading hypothesis suggests that swirls are formed where crustal magnetic anomalies, acting as mini magnetospheres, shield portions of the surface from the darkening effects of solar wind ion bombardment, thereby leaving patches that appear bright compared with their surroundings. If this hypothesis is correct, then magnetic field direction should influence swirl morphology. Using Lunar Prospector magnetometer data and Clementine reflectance mosaics, we find evidence that bright regions correspond with dominantly horizontal magnetic fields at Reiner Gamma and that vertical magnetic fields are associated with the intraswirl dark lane at Airy. We use a genetic search algorithm to model the distributions of magnetic source material at both anomalies, and we show that source models constrained by the observed albedo pattern (i.e., strongly horizontal surface fields in bright areas, vertical surface fields in dark lanes) produce fields that are consistent with the Lunar Prospector magnetometer measurements. These findings support the solar wind deflection hypothesis and may help to explain not only the general form of swirls, but also the finer aspects of their morphology. Our source models may also be used to make quantitative predictions of the near surface magnetic field, which must ultimately be tested with very low altitude spacecraft measurements. If our predictions are correct, our models could have implications for the structure of the underlying magnetic material and the nature of the magnetizing field.},

   abstract = {To gain insight into lunar surface charging in the magnetic anomaly regions, we present the results of laboratory experiments with a flowing plasma engulfing a magnetic dipole field above an insulating surface. When the dipole moment is perpendicular to the surface, large positive potentials (close to ion flow energies in eV) are measured on the surface in the dipole lobe regions, charged by the unmagnetized ions while the electrons are magnetically excluded. The potential decreases exponentially with distance from the surface on the ion (flow) Debye length scale. The surface potentials become much smaller when the dipole moment is parallel to the surface, likely due to collisionality. We discuss the implications of our laboratory results for the lunar surface charging in the magnetic anomaly regions, suggesting that the surface potential may be much higher than the generally expected several volts positive due to photoemission.},

   abstract = {The recent in situ particle measurements near the Moon by Chandrayaan-1 and Kaguya missions as well as the earlier observation by the Lunar Prospector have shown that the Moon-solar wind interaction is more complicated than believed earlier. The new observations have arisen the need for a detailed modelling of the near surface plasma-surface processes and regions near the lunar magnetic anomalies. Especially, interpretation of ion, electron, and energetic neutral atoms (ENA) observations have shown that the plasma cannot be treated as a single fluid but that kinetic effects have to be taken into account. We have studied the kinetic effects and, especially, the role of finite gyro-radius effects at the Moon by kinetic plasma simulations at three different length-scales which exist in the Moon-solar wind interaction. The solar wind interaction with a magnetic dipole, which mimics the lunar magnetic anomalies in this study, is investigated by a 3D self-consistent hybrid model (HYB-Moon) where protons are particles and electrons form a charge neutralizing mass less fluid. This study shows that the particle flux and density and the bulk velocity of the solar wind protons that hit the lunar surface just above the dipole are decreased compared to their undisturbed values. In addition, a particle "halo" region was identified in the simulation, a region around the dipole where the proton density and the particle flux are higher than in the solar wind, qualitatively in agreement with energetic hydrogen atom observations made by the Chandrayaan-1 mission. The near surface plasma within the magnetic anomaly within a Debye sheath is studied by an electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell, PLC, simulation (HYB-es). In the PIC simulation both ions and electrons are treated as particles. Further, we assume in the PIC simulation that the magnetic anomaly blocks away all solar wind particles and the simulation contains only photo-electrons. The analysis shows that the increased magnetic field decreases the strength of the electric potential and results in a thinner potential sheath than without the magnetic field. Overall, the simulations give support for the suggestions that kinetic effects play an important role on the properties of the lunar plasma environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Plasma signature around crustal magnetic fields is one of the most important topics of the lunar plasma sciences. Although recent spacecraft measurements are revealing solar-wind interaction with the lunar crustal fields on the dayside, plasma signatures around crustal fields on the night side have not been fully studied yet. Here we show evidence of plasma trapping on the closed field lines of the lunar crustal fields in the solar-wind wake, using SELENE (Kaguya) plasma and magnetic field data obtained at 14-15 km altitude from the lunar surface. In contrast to expectation on plasma cavity formation at the strong crustal fields, electron flux is enhanced above Crisium Antipode (CA) anomaly which is one of the strongest lunar crustal fields. The enhanced electron fluxes above CA are characterised by (1) occasional bi-directional field-aligned beams in the lower energy range (<150 eV) and (2) a medium energy component (150-300 eV) that has a double loss-cone distribution representing bounce motion between the two footprints of the crustal magnetic fields. The low-energy electrons on the closed field lines may come from the lunar night side surface, while supply mechanism of medium-energy electrons on the closed field line remains to be solved. We also report that a density cavity in the wake is observed not above the strongest magnetic field but in its vicinity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Moon does not have significant atmosphere and magnetic field. So it was considered like a passive absorber of incoming plasma. The latest observation revealed that the significant deflected proton fluxes exist over magnetic anomalies at lunar surface. Such deflection implies that the magnetic anomalies may act as magnetosphere-like obstacles (mini-magnetospheres), modifying the upstream plasma. The present paper is aimed to describe one possible deflection mechanism and its relations to solar wind conditions. It was obtained that for considered conditions the suggested mechanism gives too low density of deflected protons. However for the big anomaly it can give amount of deflected protons in accordance with the observations. (C) 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {SARA, the Sub-KeV Atom Analyzer, on board Chandrayaan-1 recorded the first image of a minimagnetosphere above a lunar magnetic anomaly using energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). It was shown that this magnetosphere, which is located near the Gerasimovich crater, is able to reduce the solar wind ion flux impinging onto the lunar surface by more than 50%. Following this first observation, we investigated all magnetic anomalies that are in the SARA data set. We searched for a possible correlation between the solar wind plasma parameters (dynamic pressure, magnetic field), the local magnetic field, and the reduction in the reflected hydrogen ENA flux (henceforth called shielding efficiency). Having analyzed all observations by SARA, we discovered that the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly is topologically a very simple, large-scale magnetic structure, which is favorable for this kind of investigation. Most other magnetic anomalies on the lunar surface have more small-scale features in their magnetic field structure, which complicates the interpretation of the observed data. We find a clear correlation between the plasma parameters and the shielding efficiency for the Gerasimovich case. For the other observed anomalies only about half of the cases showed such a correlation. We therefore conclude that the solar wind ions-magnetic anomaly interaction is in general more complex than in the Gerasimovich case.},

These orbits, at a constant altitude of similar to 100 km, approach gradually the Lunar Magnetic Anomaly (LMA) at the Serenitatis antipode. The data reveal tentatively a region with decrement in proton density and enhancement in temperature. The near coincidence of this region with the Serenitatis antipode probably suggests the presence of a minimagnetosphere associated with the LMA, which effectively shields and heats the incident Solar Wind (SW) protons.
